# Install 

Steps to install

```
mkdir goes_webapp
cd goes_webapp
npm init -y
npm install express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm install @dendra-science/goes-pseudo-binary
npm i ejs
npm install -g browserify
```

# First Steps - setup nodemon
Nodemon allows for the server to restart when a file is modified.


Modify the package.json so that the existing script is removed and replace with as shown

before
```

 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```


after
```

 "scripts": {
    "devStart": "nodemon server.js"
  },
```
Create a file named server.js. Don't worry aboutindex.js for now

## Auto rerun code changes
Rather than type `npm start` or `node server.js`, use nodemon to restart the 
server each time a file write occurs.  (It seems it monitors the file system below
the current directory.)

```
$ npm run devStart
```

# browserfy
This code uses browserfy.  The makefile will take the `public/js/script.js` and
converts it to `public/js/bundle.js`.  The `views/index.ejs` references 
the `bundle.js`

# GCP

What about `gcloud app update`?  Everytime I make a change it does not update?

1. `create app.yaml`
2. `gcloud init`
3. `gcloud app deploy`
4. `gcloud app logs tail -s default`
5. `gcloud app browse`
