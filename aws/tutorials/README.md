testy is notes on starter app where the code is auto dployed.
If you go to the environment or source page (wish I wrote this down when doing it)
and you click the source link for the dployed app, it does not download the source.
Instead it points you to the starter app web page.

custom_code is notes on uploading your own code as next level project.  When you click on the source there it will download the code from the webapp.
